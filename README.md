# AI-ASL-Chatbot
A Python-based tool for converting written English phrases into their corresponding American Sign Language (ASL) signs. The project uses a structured JSON data store to manage sign information, including descriptions and media URLs, and leverages a generative AI model to process user input and identify the correct signs.
